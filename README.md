# Mastro Template Basic for Bun

This is a basic TypeScript template for [Mastro](https://mastrojs.github.io) when using [Bun](https://bun.com/).

Click the green **Use this template** button in the top right to create your own copy of this repository. Then clone the **Code** to your computer.

## Run locally

The first time, you need to:

    bun install

After that, to start the server:

    bun run start

and open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

To generate the whole static site (this will create a `generated` folder):

    bun run generate

## Next steps

To see how Mastro works, [follow the guide](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/server-side-components-and-routing/).

To make sure you're on the latest Mastro version:

    bun update @jsr/mastrojs__mastro --latest
